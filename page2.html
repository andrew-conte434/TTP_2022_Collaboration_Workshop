      <p>
        <strong>
          Vivien Li has spent 25 years as an advocate for clean and accessible
          urban waterfronts. She started her advocacy career in Boston,
          Massachusetts, where she became president of The Boston Harbor
          Association (TBHA), a nonprofit dedicated to cleaning up what was once
          one of the nation’s dirtiest harbors. Li also helped to construct the
          HarborWalk, a 38-mile public walkway that lines Boston’s waterfront.
          In 2015, the long-time activist left TBHA to become president and CEO
          of Riverlife, a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit organization dedicated to
          reclaiming and restoring Pittsburghs riverfronts.

      <h3>JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Jean-Michel Cousteau comes from a family of oceanographers (his father
          was the famous deep-sea adventurer, scientist, and filmmaker
          Jacques-Yves Cousteau), so it isn’t surprising that, in 1990, he
          started the Ocean Futures Society in an effort to educate the public
          about marine conservation. Cousteau is also known for building an
          eco-oriented resort in Fiji and for becoming the first person to
          represent the Environment at an Olympic Games opening ceremony in
          2002.

      <p>
        <strong>
          Dana Beach quit his job as a successful New York investment banker at
          the age of 28 to found South Carolinas Coastal Conservation League, a
          nonprofit that raises awareness about the effects of climate change
          and works to stop environmentally harmful practices like offshore
          drilling and plastic pollution in the state. In 2002, the league
          helped stop the expansion of a port at one of the state’s islands that
          would have been as large as downtown Charleston.
