      <p>
        Viven Li has spent 25 years as an advocate for clean and accessible urban
        waterfronts. She started her advocacy career in Boston, Massachusetts,
        where she became president of The Boston Harbor Association (TBHA), a
        nonprofit dedicated to cleaning up what was once one of the nation’s
        dirtiest harbors. Li also helped to construct the HarborWalk, a 38-mile
        public walkway that lines Boston’s waterfront. In 2015, the long-time
        activist left TBHA to become president and CEO of Riverlife, a
        Pennsylvania-based nonprofit organization dedicated to reclaiming and
        restoring Pittsburghs riverfronts.

      <h2>JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU</h2>

      <p>
        Jean-Michel Cousteau comes from a family of oceanographers (his father was the famous
        deep-sea adventurer, scientist, and filmmaker Jacques-Yves Cousteau), so
        it isn’t surprising that, in 1990, he started the Ocean Futures Society
        in an effort to educate the public about marine conservation. Cousteau
        is also known for building an eco-oriented resort in Fiji and for
        becoming the first person to represent the Environment at an Olympic
        Games opening ceremony in 2002.

      <h2>DANA BEACH</h2>

      <p>
        Dana Beach quit his job as a successful New York investment banker at the age of 28
        to found South Carolinas Coastal Conservation League, a nonprofit that
        raises awareness about the effects of climate change and works to stop
        environmentally harmful practices like offshore drilling and plastic
        pollution in the state. In 2002, the league helped stop the expansion of
        a port at one of the state’s islands that would have been as large as
        downtown Charleston.
